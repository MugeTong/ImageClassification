# Image Classification

Various explorations and ablation experiments for image classification tasks.

## Introduction

This repository contains code and experiments related to image classification using deep learning techniques. It includes implementations of various architectures, training strategies, and evaluation metrics.

## Quick Start
To get started with the code, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MugeTong/ImageClassification.git
cd ImageClassification
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
> We strongly recommend using a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
> You may need to install `Pytorch` seperately before you run this project.

We use `Make` to manage the code running.

```bash
make run
```
For RTX4090, it is reasonable to finish the training in one minute.
